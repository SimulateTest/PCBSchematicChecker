# PCBSchematicChecker

Our PCB Schematic Checker is a tool that helps you make sure your Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design is error-free. You start by uploading two files: the IPC file and a PDF of your schematic. These files allow the tool to perform most of the automated checks. The tool lets you choose common power supplies, Voltage/Current Source Instruments (VI's), and other instrument models that are connected to your board. This feature helps simulate realistic operating conditions, improving the accuracy of the checks and help provide additional insights of your circuit. Lastly, you can optionally give details about the Device Under Test (DUT), like the highest voltage and current it can handle. This information allows the tool to perform extra checks to make sure the DUT can work under expected conditions with the current design and parts. Checkout some examples of what are checker is able to catch in Features.
